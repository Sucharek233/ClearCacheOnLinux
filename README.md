With this script, you can clear swap or RAM on linux.

The setup file will move the main script into ~/Scripts/clearswaporram/clearswaporram.sh

The icon will be moved to ~/Scripts/clearswaporram/icon.png

It will make a .desktop file, which will be created on your desktop.

It will also copy it to /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications so you can access it from your start menu.

Enjoy clearing!
